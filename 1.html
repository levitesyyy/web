   <h2>God</h2>
   <strong>*The Beginning</strong> 
   <p style="margin-top:40px;">  1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.<br>
         2 Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters.<br>
         3 And God said, “Let there be light,” and there was light. <br>
         4 God saw that the light was good, and he separated the light from the darkness. <br>
         5 God called the light “day,” and the darkness he called “night.” And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.</p>
